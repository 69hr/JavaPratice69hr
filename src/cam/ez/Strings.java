/*Strings in java are just characters grouped
together than you can use for printing, storing
and manipulating. Examples of Strings include a
username, password, description or anything with text!
The name "string" can be a little tricky to get used to
but don't worry too much about it right now! They aren't
too bad :) If you followed along, congrats! You learned-by-doing!
